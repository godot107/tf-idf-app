273,Programming with Big Data in R," two main implementation in r use mpi be rmpi and pbdmpi of pbdr. 
  the pbdr build on pbdmpi use spmd parallelism where every processor be consider as worker and own part of datum . the spmd parallelism introduce in mid 1980 be particularly efficient in homogeneous computing environment for large datum , for example , perform singular value decomposition on a large matrix , or perform cluster analysis on high - dimensional large datum . on the other hand , there be no restriction to use manager / worker parallelism in spmd parallelism environment . 
  the rmpi use manager / worker parallelism where one main processor ( manager ) server as the control of all other processor ( worker ) . the manager / worker parallelism introduce around early 2000 be particularly efficient for large task in small cluster , for example , bootstrap method and monte carlo simulation in applied statistic since i.i.d . assumption be commonly use in most statistical analysis . in particular , task pull parallelism have good performance for rmpi in heterogeneous computing environment . 
 the idea of spmd parallelism be to let every processor do the same amount of work , but on different part of a large datum set . for example , a modern gpu be a large collection of slow co - processor that can simply apply the same computation on different part of relatively small datum , but the spmd parallelism end up with an efficient way to obtain final solution ( i.e. time to solution be short ) . It be clear that pbdr be not only suitable for small cluster , but be also more stable for analyze big datum and more scalable for supercomputer . in short , pbdr

 the analysis of distribution be fundamental in machine learning and statistic ,   and many algorithm in these field rely on information theoretic approach such as entropy , mutual information , or kullback – leibler divergence .   however , to estimate these quantity , one must first either perform density estimation , or employ sophisticated space - partition / bias - correction strategy which be typically infeasible for high - dimensional datum . l. song .

285,Kernel embedding of distributions," method base on the kernel embedding of distribution sidestep these problem and also possess the follow advantage : 
  data may be model without restrictive assumption about the form of the distribution and relationship between variable 
   intermediate density estimation be not need 
   practitioners may specify the property of a distribution most relevant for their problem ( incorporate prior knowledge via choice of the kernel ) 
  if a characteristic kernel be use , then the embedding can uniquely preserve all information about a distribution , while thank to the kernel trick , computation on the potentially infinite - dimensional rkhs can be implement in practice as simple gram matrix operation 
  dimensionality - independent rate of convergence for the empirical kernel mean ( estimate use sample from the distribution )   to the kernel embedding of the true underlie distribution can be prove . 
  learn algorithm base on this framework exhibit good generalization ability and finite sample convergence , while often be simple and more effective than information theoretic method 
 thus , learn via the kernel embedding of distribution offer a principl drop - in replacement for information theoretic approach and be a framework which not only subsume many popular method in machine learning and statistic as special case , but also can lead to entirely new learn algorithm .
